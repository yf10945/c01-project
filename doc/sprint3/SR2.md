# Unfinished tasks (in the form of new user stories)
* As a registered user, I want to be able to access my profile to update/view my profile picture, my status, and my “about me” section.
   * As a registered user, I want to be able to see my own ACS in my profile.
   * As a registered user, I want to link my social media accounts so that other people can keep in touch with me
* As a registered user, I want to be able to view posts (includes a title, message, and original poster’s name) so that I can see what other people have to say
* As a registered user, I want to be able to create posts so that I can share what I have to say
Practices to continue:
* Continue to discuss during our daily standups
   * Discuss what we have finished, what we’re currently working on, and any problems we had during the sprint.
* Continue to work together on reviewing pull requests
   * Allows us to test the code by other members before merging regardless of no branch conflicts.

# New Practices might want use next sprint
* Create a development branch to test integration of new features with the current code and then merge a stable version with master
* Look up some modern UI design guides and examples to help us design a better looking UI
* Fully prototype the UI in Figma so we know exactly how it will look and feel
* Have backend work on some frontend components to lessen the load on frontend
Practices to stop:
* Directly modifying master without pull requests.

# Best/worst experiences during sprint 1
* Best:
   * Able to work together and set goals daily.
   * Managed to have a consistent meeting on every mandatory day.
   * Communicated necessary changes between frontend and backend
* Worst:
   * Weren’t able to efficiently finish user stories
      * Felt slow when discussing the same user stories for multiple days
   * Issues with connecting front and back end: CORS errors, cookies, authentication and tracking, etc.
   * Bad/Unbalanced distribution of work (Frontend had much more features to create/make compared to backend features)
