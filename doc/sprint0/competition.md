Sports-related competition**

* ESPN app (espn.com/espn/apps/espn)
   * Purely sports news and information
   * No/very little community aspect
Social-related competition (all of these social media apps allow people to create their own posts with likes/dislikes and comments as a primary feature).
* Facebook (facebook.com)
   * Users can send people friend requests and message them freely, as well as play minigames (single/multiplayer).
* Twitter (twitter.com)
   * Social media app that allows people to post their thoughts in the moment, mostly on current events
* Reddit (reddit.com)
   * Social media app that contains a huge variety of smaller communities, moderated by the community.
Sports betting related competition (i.e. draftkings.com)
* Offers almost the same and more functionality such as picking players/teams, making their own fantasy team, a platform for many competitive sports, competing against other users, and etc.
* However, their approach is in making money from bets rather than having a prestige around their skills in predictions


**How is your product different?**

The ESPN app is only for news and live games. Facebook and Twitter don’t focus on sports because their apps are directed towards a wider audience. Reddit has smaller communities for specific topics, including sports. Draftkings requires actual money to bet. However, none of these products are able to estimate how credible people are in analysing sport events.


**If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios,**
1. **Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?**

Our users are for sports analysts and fans. Our product is better for sports fans who would like to prove that they know what they’re talking about. With ACS (Analytical Credibility Score), we will be able to quantify each user’s credibility in analysing sports. 


2. **Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? and, what would it take from them to do so?**

The competitors didn’t focus on these users because the goals for the social platforms involved a much broader audience and a different function, as stated above. If they decided to focus on these types of users, they could drive away other users from their platforms who are not as invested into sports as fans and analysts.


The sports related competitions have a slightly different demographic and function as well. Some of these platforms serve to inform people and others to provide an extreme and perhaps risky way to show off. These platforms also lack social interaction, which is a main feature for Sportcred. If these platforms included more social interaction, opinions and less risk/reward, information from news could be biased and betters will be less satisfied.
