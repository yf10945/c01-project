How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
* Used discord to organize the meetings and communicated on what to do
* Used google drive to share all deliverables and work synchronously

How did you make decisions?
* Asked for majority opinion on any situation where there was no definite answer
* Everyone contributes by having a suggestion when decision making

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
* We used scrum poker with an online tool that allows us to vote using cards to have a consensus on each estimate
* Typically needed 1-2 rounds of voting while also discussing afterwards by providing everyone’s opinion on the user story to ensure a general consensus

Did you meet in person or online?
* Online

How frequently did you meet?
* Every 2-3 days at a certain time that is discussed in the previous meeting

What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
* Continue to do the same, however be more organized on what to do next (planning)
   * This will save time and also give everyone a good idea of the overall project and not be scattered doing individual parts without communication
* Make sure everyone is doing their part and everyone continues to stay updated on the current project progress
