**SPORTCRED**

**Objective:**

Our objective is to build a social iOS/web basketball analysis and debate app that quantifies a user’s analytical ability in sports using an original point-based system called Analytical Credibility Score (A.C.S.). The score is based on the user’s performance in picks & predictions for basketball matches, analysis and debate, trivia, participation in discussions and how long the user has been a member for, which are all done in the app. Users can interact with other members through in-app posts, discussions, debates, trivia, and they can also see other members’ A.C.S. and activity.


**Key Personas:**

Sport fans (casual/hardcore, from teenagers to adults/seniors), coaches, sport analysts, athletes
Dave: the casual sports fan
* Dave is 16 years old, and watches basketball whenever his friends do. He likes talking about recent games with his friends and they often debate about who the best basketball player is.
John: the hardcore sports fan
* John is a 20 year old man who knows everything about basketball, and watches every game live. His favorite team switches every season because he knows all about the best upcoming and veteran players that show up in every team. He knows 30 years of NBA history and has watched countless hours of basketball while studying for university exams. 
Charles: the sports analyst
* Charles is a 40 year old sports analyst. He has been watching every team, recording every game, and keeping record of every point scored. He gives commentaries for a living and does his best to stay unbiased during live commentaries. 

**Key Scenarios:**

**Trivia**

Dave thinks he knows a lot about NBA history, so he challenges his buddy John to in a questionnaire about important events and players. Little did he know, John was an expert on this topic and completely smashed him, getting every question correct. Dave is surprised to see how knowledgeable his friend was, but learned a lot about NBA history through the quiz questions. John gets a prize of X ACS added to his ACS as a result of his outstanding performance, while Dave sadly loses Y for his lack of knowledge.


**Picks & Predictions**

John wishes to earn ACS points and decides to play from the Picks & Predictions as his favourite team has an upcoming match in the regular season. John logs in successfully with his registered account and selects the Picks & Predictions on the The Zone module. John views a list of daily picks in the regular season for upcoming games that have not started yet. John finally finds the match he is interested in and chooses the team he predicts will win. After the game has finished, the results are in and shows he predicted correctly from the match and is rewarded with ACS points.

**Analysis/Debate**

As a professional sports analyst, Charles is constantly looking for ways to practice his analysis skills so that he can keep improving his commentaries. He receives an email notification for the 2 new analysis/debate questions of the day on Sportcred, so he logs in to Sportcred, navigates to the Analysis/Debate section, and types his analyses. He is satisfied with his analyses, so he submits them and waits for the other people that were given the same question to answer. In the evening, he receives another email notification that says all analyses were submitted for one of the questions and it's ready for review. He opens the Analysis/Debate section again and critically reads both of the responses. He is amazed by how insightful one of the responses is and learns a lot from it, so he slides the agreeance scale to the highest rating. However, the other response did not support it's arguments very well so he gives it a low agreeance. A few hours later, he sees that the other people strongly agreed with his analysis so he gains a good amount of ACS.


**Key Principles:**

People like to share, whether it’s their skill, opinions or knowledge.

**Principle: ACS prestige**

High ACS scores should feel hard-earned and look very impressive to other users on the app, hence the prestige. Users should feel encouraged to keep improving daily and ranking up a tier should feel satisfying.

**Principle: Social Interaction**

This platform allows sports fans and enthusiasts to put their statements and opinions in discussions to be judged as well as analyze other users’ statements and opinions as well.
