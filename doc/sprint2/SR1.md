Participants: 
* Our team: Yes
* TA: Swarup Srini
* Product Owners: Jacob, Warren Ward
Unfinished tasks (in the form of new user stories):
* As a registered user, I want to be able to access my profile to update/view my profile picture, my status, and my “about me” section.
   * As a registered user, I want to be able to see my own ACS in my profile.
   * As a registered user, I want to be able to change my information in profile so that I can share basic information about myself via the app
   * As a registered user, I want to view my profile, so that I can make sure my account info is correct.
* As a new user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can explore the app.
Practices to continue:
* Continue to discuss during our daily standups
   * Discuss what we have finished, what we’re currently working on, and any problems we had during the sprint.
* Continue to work together on reviewing pull requests
   * Allows us to test the code by other members before merging regardless of no branch conflicts.
Practices to stop:
* Committing directly to master with “base structure updates”
   * Regardless of structure changes, it could potentially break the code in some way
Best/worst experiences during sprint 1:
* Best:
   * Able to work together and set goals daily.
   * Managed to have a consistent meeting on every mandatory day.
* Worst:
   * Weren’t able to efficiently finish user stories
      * Felt slow when discussing the same user stories for multiple days
   * Misinterpreted the deadline for project demo.
      * Will keep this in mind for the following sprints.
